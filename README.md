## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

There are many ways to achieve this final result, but within the process I've only used what i know so far, so it became harder, therefore solving this challenge showed me that, although its not the simpler way, I did it, and this motivates me to keep going.

### Continued development

Manipulating data, json files, which I didn't do on this challenge. Learning how to simplify coding with proper knowledge.
